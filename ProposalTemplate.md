## Project Topic



## Rationale 

_Add a paragraph or two describing why this data is interesting or relevant to you and your audience. What do you want you audience to take away. Are there questions you're trying to answer? Note: this section is likely to change as you work with your data, but it's helpful to have an idea at this point._


## Data Sets

Add a brief description of each of the data sources you will be using. Add links or screenshots where possible.

## Project Track & Stack

Describe which category your final result will fit into. It's okay to be creative and diverge a bit, so let us know if that is the case.
1. Creative d3 viz
1. Use Libraries like plotly or leaflet to build multiple view of your data source
1. Interative dashboard that builds multiple views from the same data
1. ETL or Data processing on a Python server (must still have visualizations and interaction but they can be simpler than other projects) 

What stack components are you going for?
1. Back-end API server?
1. Scraping script?
1. ETL Script?
1. Database? What kind?
1. Front-end compenents html/css/js (Required)
1. How will you deploy the project


## Sketches & Inspiration

_Describe the end product you're going for from a user perspective_

_Add image(s) showing your proposed final design. This could be a mockup of a dashboard, a quick sketch of the visualizations you will create, a ETL Diagram of your data, or somthing similar. Feel free to be creative_

## OPTIONAL Work load organization

This is not required but it may be helpful to think through at the beginning of your project. How will you divide up the work? How will you use git to colloborate? How will you prioritize tasks and deliverables? How will you track what needs to be done?
